## Game Overview

Star Realms is a fast-paced, two-player deck-building game set in a sci-fi universe. Players start with a weak starter deck and acquire more powerful cards from a shared trade row throughout the game. The goal is to reduce your opponent's Authority from 50 to 0.

---

## Setup

1. Each player starts with **50 Authority** (health/life points)
2. Each player receives a **personal starter deck** consisting of:
   - 8 Scouts (provide 1 Trade each)
   - 2 Vipers (provide 1 Combat each)
// the number of explorer cards is not limited
3. Place **10 Explorer cards** face-up in a separate pile (always available for purchase)
4. Shuffle the **Trade Deck** and deal 5 cards face-up to form the **Trade Row**
5. **Starting hands:**
   - First player draws **3 cards**
   - Second player draws **5 cards**

---

## Turn Structure

Each turn consists of three phases:

### 1. Main Phase

During this phase, you may perform any of the following actions in any order:

- **Play cards** from your hand
- **Use abilities** on your cards (primary, ally, or scrap abilities)
- **Acquire cards** from the Trade Row using accumulated Trade
- **Attack** your opponent's bases or their Authority using accumulated Combat

### 2. Discard Phase

- All unused Trade and Combat is lost
- All Ships in play are placed in your discard pile
- All remaining cards in your hand are discarded

### 3. Draw Phase

- Draw **5 cards** from your personal deck
- If your deck is empty, shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck
- Your turn ends

---

## Card Types

### Ships

- Provide **one-time effects** when played
- Remain in play (visible) until the Discard Phase
- After use, they go to your discard pile
- Trigger their primary ability immediately upon being played

### Bases

- **Persist between turns** until destroyed by your opponent
- Have a **Defense value** (shown in bottom-right corner) indicating how much Combat is needed to destroy them in a single turn
- Primary abilities can be used once per turn during your Main Phase
- Come in two varieties:

#### Regular Bases
- Have a **grey shield** icon
- Provide benefits but no protection
- Opponent can choose to attack them or ignore them

#### Outposts

- Provide protection in addition to their abilities

## Combat Mechanics

### Attacking

- Combat accumulates during your turn
- You may attack **multiple times** per turn
- Valid targets:
  - Opponent's Authority (direct damage)
  - Opponent's Bases (must spend Combat equal to Defense value)

### Outpost Priority

- If opponent has an **Outpost** in play, you **must destroy it first**
- You cannot attack their Authority or regular Bases while an Outpost remains
- Multiple Outposts: you choose which to attack

### Destroying Bases

- Spend Combat **equal to or greater than** the Base's Defense value
- Base is immediately discarded
- Excess Combat can be used on other targets

---

## Strategic Tips

### Deck Thinning

- Scrap your weak starter cards (Scouts and Vipers) early
- A smaller deck draws powerful cards more frequently
- Machine Cult excels at this strategy

### Faction Focus

- Ally abilities reward playing multiple cards of the same faction
- Don't spread too thin across all four factions
- 2-3 factions is often optimal

### Base Defense

- Outposts protect your Authority
- Forcing opponents to waste Combat on bases buys you time
- Trade Federation and Machine Cult have strong defensive bases

### Trade Row Awareness

- Watch what your opponent might want
- Sometimes buying a card to deny it is correct
- Blobs can scrap Trade Row cards to deny opponents

### Authority Management

- Gaining Authority extends the game
- Longer games favor deck-building strategies
- Aggressive strategies aim to win before opponents stabilize

---

## Winning the Game

The game ends immediately when a player's **Authority reaches 0**. That player loses, and their opponent wins.

There is no deck-out condition in Star Realms. If your deck is empty, simply shuffle your discard pile to create a new deck.

- **Solo/Co-op Play** - Fight against automated opponents
